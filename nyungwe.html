                <h2>Nyungwe National Park</h2>
                <p>Nyungwe is one of the oldest rainforests in Africa, and the largest expanse of forest in Rwanda, covering 1,019 km2 of dense Afromontane forests, bamboo-covered slopes, grasslands and wetlands. The park feeds two of the world‚Äôs largest rivers, the Congo and the Nile, and provides a significant portion of Rwanda‚Äôs fresh water. Over 1,100 recorded plant species, 345 bird species and 85 known mammal species, including 13 of Africa‚Äôs primates ‚Äì notably, chimpanzee, Ruwenzori black-and-white colobus and L‚ÄôHoest‚Äôs monkeys ‚Äì are found in this exceptional landscape.<br>

                <h2>Historically, Nyungwe</h2>
                <p>Historically, Nyungwe‚Äôs rich fauna and flora was exposed to rampant poaching, illegal mining, unsustainable harvesting and agricultural encroachment, endangering the survival of its rich biodiversity. Following a successful partnership with the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) in Akagera National Park, in 2020 African Parks was invited by the Rwandan government to sign a 20-year agreement to manage Nyungwe. Together, we are working to restore and protect biodiversity, engage with the local communities, and develop a strong tourism offering to improve economic sustainability of the park. Today, the park is building a sense of ownership of conservation among the people who live around it,
                   and developing an ecologically healthy and financially self-sufficient asset.

                </h2>
                <p>Nyungwe has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, highlighting it as a place of outstanding universal value with significant biological diversity and vital ecological and biological processes.
                </p>
                <p>The number of endemic species found in Nyungwe is greater than in any other forest in the Albertine Rift Mountains</p>
                   <p>A number of chimpanzee groups are tracked and monitored daily, and visited by tourists.</p>
                   <p>Nyungwe‚Äôs eco-ranger team is made up of community members, many of whom have renounced their previous involvement in illegal activities, and have contributed to the removal of 60% of all poachers‚Äô snares from the forest.
                  </p>
                  <p>A mushroom farming community project, funded by Nyungwe National Park, is becoming a thriving local enterprise</p>
                <p>Over 6,000 students are members of 85 wildlife clubs, with almost 1,000 children visiting the park annually</p>

                     <h2>Partners</h2>
                     African Parks signed a 20-year management agreement with the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) for Nyungwe National Park in October 2020. Nyungwe is the second national park in Rwanda with which African Parks has partnered.
