                <h2>Mount Karisimbi Hiking in Rwanda </h2>
                <p>Mount Karisimbi is the highest of the volcanoes found within the Virunga ranges of mountains. It is the eleventh highest in Africa. This inactive volcano is found in the Volcanoes National Park and along the Climbing Mount Karisimbi Volcanoborder between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Rising up to 4,507 meters, Mount is surrounded by other neighboring volcanoes like Mikeno, Nyiragongo and Bisoke. The mountain gets its name Karisimbi (Kinyarwanda for ‚ÄúWhite Shell‚Äù) from the snow that usually covers the top during the dry season. Karisimbi has a caldera Branca and two craters in the summit with the largest being

                    <br>
                    Visitors to the Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda usually combine Gorilla trekking with a Karisimbi mountain hike

                 Climbing mount Karisimbi can be a strenuous but special experience. Because of its location within the Volcanoes National Park, hikers should expect to come across several bird species, Hiking Mount Karisimbi Volcanosee golden monkeys or mountain gorillas (occasionally). There is even the possibility of visiting the grave of Dian Fossey, a famous primatologist who studied mountain gorillas extensively.

                    The trail and path towards the summit of Karisimbi contains great landscape, volcanic features, dense forest and vegetation which are beautiful to behold. However, the hike may involve navigating through thick jungle, steep slopes and muddy trails in the rainy season. It‚Äôs for this reason that hiking Mount Karisimbi is best done during the drier periods between December to March and June to early October.

                <h2>Facts, Weather and Hike Costs</h2>
                <p>One needs to be in good shape, have the endurance and stamina that is required to navigate through steep and difficult sections of the mountain slopes. This is especially important if you are hiking in a group. You wouldn‚Äôt want to keep your fellow hikers waiting for you. Hikers also need to prepare mentally for the high altitude conditions which can be distressing and hence a cause for slowing one down.

                    Mount Karisimbi Hiking can be organized using a local Tour Operator. The Tour Operator should secure the permits, organize tents, meals and other hiking equipment. Extra Porters are available for hire at a cost of about $20. These extra porters can help carry heavy cameras, tents and other hiking equipment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Mount Karisimbi Hiking is usually completed in 2 days. Hikers need to first go to the park headquarters to register and be briefed by the park Warden and Guides. Hiking Mount KarisimbiAfter the briefing, hikers are driven to the starting point which is located at the foot of Mount Bisoke
                    <span class="more-text" id="more2">
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Ascending to the summit lasts 7 hours at most but hikers often stop mid-way (at an altitude of 3,700 meters) for the night. A camp is set where dinner is prepared as everyone takes a rest in preparation for the final climb the nest day. After enduring the cold night and having early morning breakfast, Hikers should be fresh and ready to get to the summit.
                         This final push takes only 1 hour but is the most challenging. That is because the section from the camp to the summit is steeper and more difficult to navigate ‚Äì especially if there is thick mud, strong winds and fog which reduces visibility.
                         Once at the summit, the scenery is spectacular and beautiful to behold. Hikers should have great views of the Muhabura volcano, the Nyamulagira volcano, Nyiragongo, the great forests/vegetation within the Virunga ranges and the Democratic Republic of Congo. After getting enough of the great views, Hikers should get ready for a 6 hour descent back to the starting point and then to the park office.
