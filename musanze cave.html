                <h2>Musanze Caves in Rwanda</h2>
                <p>Exploring the Musanze caves in Rwanda is one of the latest additions on the menu for potential tourists going to Rwanda. When the activity was first launched in 2014, 400 visitors were received within the first two months ‚Äì a great testament to Rwanda‚Äôs ability to market and attract tourists. Increased tourism activities in Rwanda have been of great economic benefit to country. Sites like the Musanze caves allow locals in particular to showcase and sell their art crafts to tourists passing by their communities. Apart from the art crafts, the locals can also demonstrate traditional way of living, cultures and rich history whenever an opportunity presents itself. 
                     So what is it like visiting the Musanze caves?
                    <br>

                        visiting the grave of Dian Fossey Mountain Hiking and canoeing lakes like Ruhondo among many others. The Musanze caves were significant during the ancient times as they were used by the local Kinyarwanda tribes as the venue for crowning their new kings. More recently, the caves were made famous as a shelter for thousands of refugees who had escaped the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. Visitors to the caves are welcomed by beautiful green scenery surrounding the cave and especially on the top.  
                        The caves offer great views of the wider Virunga ranges which include volcanoes like Karisimbi, Muhabura and Gahinga.

                <h2>musanze cave </h2>
                <p>The caves are generally cold and quiet on the inside with streams of water slowly flowing out of the rock ceiling and down the rocky walls to holes underneath the cave floor. It‚Äôs usually takes between one to two The Musanze Caves in Rwandahours to complete exploring the caves. The caves consist of complex and numerous tunnels, many of which are home to thousands of bats. The bats can be seen hanging on the cave walls that have been darkened by smoke that has been partly trapped by the numerous cobwebs for thousands of years
                    <br>
                    Exploring the cave involves maneuvering though a two kilometer dark tunnel that consists of hardened rocks. There is complete silence inside the caves that is only interrupted by whispers, flying bats and echoes from human voices far away. One will need a strong torch/light, helmet, gloves, boots and a head cap to navigate through the various tunnels during the one to two hour trail.
                    <span class="more-text" id="more2">
                        After touring the Musanze caves, visitors can go for a cultural experience with one of local tribes living near the caves. While with the locals in their homes or communal centers, visitors will learn the art of making hunting tools like bows and arrows, weaving the ‚ÄúAgaseke‚Äù basket using fingers, brewing local beer (known as ‚ÄúUgwagwa‚Äù) using bananas, constructing beehives using local material and harvesting/producing honey.  
                        The ever cheerful locals can also demonstrate how to use plants, soil and even cow dung to produce nice art pieces.
                        <br>
                        Although touring the Musanze caves is one of the top things to do while on a Rwanda Wildlife safari. Visiting the caves is best done after completing the other major activities like mountain hiking and gorilla trekking.
                         Visiting the Musanze caves alongside wildlife or hiking tours makes for a truly memorable safari in Rwanda
